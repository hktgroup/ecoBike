EcoBike is an multiplatform app that our team work during Hack NYU. The app is base on the concept of health and behavior Change.
EcoBike allows you to track your biking, calculate your burned calories and it will tell you by how much you have reduce your
environmental footprint. It is plan to keep compund statistics since you install the app. If time allows, we might scalate it 
to social interactions, so you can share, and calculate within your group your environmental footprint. The Website will allow you 
to see your stats in a practical way.
 
 The app is develop in Ionic, while the back-end is written in Node.js. Where are using MongoDb for the database.
