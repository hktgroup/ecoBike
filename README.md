EcoBike is a multiplatform app that our team build during Hack NYU. The app is base on the concept of health and behavior Change. EcoBike allows you to track your biking, calculate your burned calories and it will tell you by how much you have reduced your environmental footprint. It will compound statistics since you install the app. If time allows, we might escalate it to social interactions, so you can share, and calculate within your group your environmental footprint. The Website will allow you to see your stats in a practical way.

The app is developed in Ionic, while the back-end is written in Node.js. We are using MongoDB for the database
